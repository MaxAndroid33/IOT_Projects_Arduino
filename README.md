# IOT_Projects_Arduino

This repository contains a collection of Internet of Things (IoT) projects that have been developed using the Arduino platform. The projects range from simple sensors to more complex systems and showcase the capabilities of the Arduino platform in the IoT domain.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need an Arduino board, a computer, and some basic electronics components such as sensors, actuators, and wires. You will also need to install the Arduino software on your computer, which is available for free from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Project List

The following projects are included in this repository:

1. [Blink](Blink): A simple project that demonstrates how to blink an LED using the Arduino board.

2. [FireBaseIOTFlutter](FireBaseIOTFlutter): A project that integrates the Arduino platform with Firebase and Flutter to control an LED over the internet.

3. [GET_POST](GET_POST): A project that demonstrates how to send data to a server using the GET and POST methods.

4. [ModBusTest](ModBusTest): A project that demonstrates the implementation of the Modbus protocol using the Arduino board.

5. [RobotArm](RobotArm): A project that demonstrates the control of a robotic arm using the Arduino board.

6. [RTDB](RTDB): A project that demonstrates the integration of the Arduino platform with Real-Time Database (RTDB) to control an LED over the internet.

7. [Sun_Water_Heater](Sun_Water_Heater): A project that demonstrates the control of a water heater using the sun as the energy source.

8. [Test_WebserverSRdata](Test_WebserverSRdata): A project that tests the communication between the Arduino board and a webserver.

9. [WebServer](WebServer): A project that demonstrates how to create a webserver using the Arduino board and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.
